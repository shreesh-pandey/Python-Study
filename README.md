Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository documents my weekly learning, hands-on projects, and progress toward mastering Python.

📅 **Goal**: Study for 30 minutes every day  
🧠 **Tracking Tool**: [My Notion Dashboard](https://www.notion.so/Python-1f9f41288a83815bb0c5d9d9abe78667?pvs=4)  
🗃 **Structure**: Each week has its own folder with code and documentation

## 🧠 How I’m Learning

Each week includes:
- 📺 Watching curated YouTube videos
- ✍️ Taking notes in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/YOUR-LINK)
- 🧪 Building projects & stretch exercises
- ✅ Tracking goals with GitHub Issues and Commits

---

## 🧪 Projects

Each weekly folder contains:
- `README.md` – explanation of the project
- `.py` files – working code
- Additional files (data, input/output examples, etc.)

---

## 📌 Specialization Options (Post Week 11)

Depending on interest, I’ll choose one or more of the following:
- 🔹 Web Development (Flask/Django)
- 🔹 Data Science (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- 🔹 Automation/Scripting (os, schedule, pyautogui)
- 🔹 GUI Development (tkinter, PyQt)
- 🔹 Game Development (pygame)

---

## 🔮 Upcoming!

I will continue updating this repository with new details, insights, and experiences I acquire in the future.
